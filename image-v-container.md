## Difference between Container vs Image

Image:

- The actual package
- Artifact that can be moved around
- Can exist without a container

Container:

- Start the application
- Layers of images
- Can not exist without an image

If it's running is a Container, if it's only the content downloaded in you machine, it's an image
